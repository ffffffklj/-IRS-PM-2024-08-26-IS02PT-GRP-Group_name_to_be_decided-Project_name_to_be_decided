## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In today's digital age, travelers are constantly seeking personalized experiences to make their journeys memorable. The Travel Recommendation System (TRS) aims to address this demand by leveraging advanced algorithms and data analytics to provide customized travel suggestions. This system analyzes various data points, including tourists’ evaluations, users’ past behavior, and current trends, to offer tailored recommendations for destinations. By integrating existing evaluations and machine reasoning techniques, the TRS adapts to deliver more accurate and relevant suggestions over time. This project not only enhances user satisfaction but also helps travel businesses optimize their offerings, ultimately contributing to a more engaging and efficient travel planning experience.
